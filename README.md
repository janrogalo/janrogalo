Hi there! I am Jan👋

✨ A little bit about me:

🎓 Right now I am on my 8th month of a journey to rebrand - my goal is to become Full Stack Web Developer, with a slight inclinations towards Front-end.

🔎 I am looking for a job or internship as a junior engineer with the possibility of development - I believe that the best way to learn things is through solving real-life problems.

📁 I am a fast-learner, able to adapt easily and work hard. Most of all I understand commitment - I am not a quitter.

💪 Besides I love board games, legos and making electronic music! 😎
